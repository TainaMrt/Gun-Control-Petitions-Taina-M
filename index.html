  <h1 class="title">We Need Tighter Restrictions On Guns</h1>
  <div class="section-one">
    <h1> Why this is important to me: </h1>
  </div>
  <p class="one">The reason why putting tighter restricion on gun control is important to me is because there are so
    many
    unnecessary deaths that happen everyday BECAUSE of the lack of gun control and these deaths could be easily
    avoided
    if we just had tighter restrictions on guns. </p>

    <h1> Statistics: </h1>
  </div>
  <p>Did you know that in statistics recorded as recent as 2020 that 45,222 people in the US died due to gun-related
    incidents/injuries? 54% of those deaths are caused by suicide and 43% of those deaths are murders. (3% of those
    deaths are classified as "other") Did you ALSO know that at least 12 children die A DAY due to gun violence related
    incidents in the USA? </p> <p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/">Heres the link to the website that I got my information from!</a></p>
