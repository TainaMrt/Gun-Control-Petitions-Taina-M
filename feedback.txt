What do you like most about your partner’s websites?Think about: The message, the topic, the design, the layout, etc


I think maybe the layout works well.


How easy is your partner’s website to read? What, if anything, could be improved about its readability?Think about: How is the information on the page organized? Are there clear headings and clear sections? Is there too much information? Is the text on the webpage readable?

It is easy to read the info on the page. My only concern is any kind of reference or link for the statistics.

Take a look at the project rubric or Daily Progress Checklists.  Are there any coding features missing?
